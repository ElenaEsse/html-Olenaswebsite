<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Olena Serdyuk but i prefer to be called Helena.<br/> I was born in Ukraine on June 28, 1995 in a small town named Reshnivka.
I liked drawing, painting and everything that was art. I used to have a lot of dreams and ideas about my future, for example
when i was 11 y,o I wanted so much to become a veterinarian, but then i changed this idea because my mom told me that she would take me
to Italy to live with her, so i started to dream about my life in Italy.
 I have been living in Italy for so many years in a little, quiet city in the South, Caserta.
There i completed the High School and University. Because of so many years living in Italy, i speak Italian language Very well.
I can say that it became my first language.<br/> I speak 5 languages: Italian, Ukrainian, Russian, English and Spanish.</p>

<p>Now is April 2025 and courently i live in the United States Of America with my mom. In September I am starting Colledge classes,
  I applied for Associate degree in Computer Information Systems. I like this major because it's about Information Tecnologie
  applied to the Business. I will study programming and Computing, but also economy.</p>

<p>Now i would like to tell you abot my private life. Two months ago I met a men I fell in love with. He is truly amazing
  and with him i feel very good: he is romantic, sweet, gentelman and very responsible and smart. I belive he is the one.
  He helps me to practice my Spanish because this is his native language. I hope one day i will learn Spanish very well.
